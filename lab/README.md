# Lab: Compare supervised classification models on breast cancer dataset.

## 1. Goal
The goal of this lab is to repeat the steps seen in the session notebooks on a new classification data set: Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.


## 2. What to do

### 2.2 Datasets
The data is hosted on UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
we will need `wdbc.names` and `wdbc.data` from the data folder on UCI.


### 2.3 Classifiers
- linear classifier, `SVC(kernel='linear')`  
- non-linear classifier, `RandomForestClassifier(random_state=82)` 

### 2.4 Setup on Jupyter notebook server

1. With your UCalgary IT credentials, login at: https://ucalgary.syzygy.ca/
1. Open a terminal
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ypauchard/ml-intro.git`
1. Create a copy of `breast-cancer-classification.ipynb` and rename by adding your group number, e.g. `breast-cancer-classification-group1.ipynb`

### 2.5 Complete TODOs in notebook
The notebook contains TODOs to either complete code or answer questions. 

Use the session notebooks as a reference to complete the code.

When development is complete:
- Remove any unnecessary cells. 
- Restart kernel and run all cells
- Download a copy of the notebook
- Export the notebook as PDF (File->Export->PDF) and download



## 3. What to hand in
The notebook `breast-cancer-classification-groupX.ipynb` and a PDF version of the notebook (File->Export->PDF)
